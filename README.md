Summary of the projects I have done.


# [SQL: Technical Assessment 1](https://github.com/michelleng95/SQL-Assessment-1)
This is a technical assessment I did for a company.
I used MySQL to create the tables as per the questions, and came up with solutions to produce the outcomes requested.

# [Starbucks Survey Analysis](https://github.com/michelleng95/R-Starbucks-Survey-Analysis)
In this project, I am 'hired' by Starbucks to conduct insightful analysis to help senior
management understand more about how to improve customer engagement and profitability.

I was given a dataset consisting of survey data on a random sample of 10,000 Starbucks Coffee customers. The survey was done in Orange County, CA.
I used R Studio to prepare the dataset for analysis by cleaning it.
